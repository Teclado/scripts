Here are some utils for url encoding strings.

- src/int2utf8.c: Take numeric (integer) arguments and prints its UTF-8 characters.
- src/utf8table.c: Prints the entire UTF-8 table (from 0 to 255).
- src/urlencode.c: Encode or decode urls.

All of them are plain C code ready to compile with something like gcc <source> -o <executable>
